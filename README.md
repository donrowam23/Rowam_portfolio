Recommendations:

Based on the uncovered insights, the following recommendations have been provided:

To manage attrition arising from education, it is important to upskill and reskill employees to fill open positions. This enables them to handle new roles that can emerge as the company evolves avoiding layoffs. They can also fill the vacancies left by retired employees.

Since Salary is the peak motivator of employees to stay working, it is wise for the company to review their compensation plan.
Pay within market rates to make it easier to retain staff and periodically evaluate what you are offering employees financially.

To encourage employees stay with the company, allow flexibility.People who leave the organisation mostly are between ages 26-35 of which could be reduced by offering them a flexible working environment. This will enable thhe organisation accomodate and retain more people.

Hire productively. Most employees who leave the company are those joined soon. This may mean they are not aware of the positions described. Skill based hiring is recommended as it looks beyond degrees, job titles and years of experience making sure new hires stick with the company for some more time.
